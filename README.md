# File Organizer

[Download Installer](https://github.com/KodyInBoise/FileOrganizer/raw/stable/FileOrganizer_Installer.exe "Download File Organizer")

A simple file management desktop app that helps keep your files organized and your directories clean.

## How it works

Users create "Rules" that watch a source directory and assosciate a "Keyword" that will trigger a "Move", "Copy"
or "Delete" action on a user set interval.

## Notes

-Has not had much testing yet; this is simply a small side project with very little time invested.

-Currently does not have any settings. Need to add options for app minimizing and other things.

-Deleting files is permanent. Planning on adding an optional "Temp" location storing deleted files for a period of time.
